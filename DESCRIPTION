Description: This package consists of a set of a number of mgcv-style basis
    constructors and predict methods. These bases involve transformations of
    variables, in order to reparameterize the basis before using other more
    standard mgcv bases. For example, the "dt" basis is for domain
    transformations, and the "pi" basis parameterizes the interaction between
    terms of a multivariate basis.
